# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-03-02

## Status

Accepted

Amended by [2. Use adr-tools to manage ADRs](0002-use-adr-tools-to-manage-adrs.md)

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project. These decisions need to be recorded in a way that is useful to future developers who are unaware of, or have forgotten, the details of the decision. These future developers could be us.

We need a system for recording decisions that is consistent and easy to implement. We believe that large record formats can be burdensome for writers and readers alike, and that they are likely to fall into disuse because developers will not see good value for effort when reading or writing them.

## Decision

We will create and use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

We will take on the additionl effort of creating ADRs. These ADRs should allow stakeholders and future developers greated insight into the context and purpose of architectural decisions relating to this project. For more details on the motivation for ADRs see Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
